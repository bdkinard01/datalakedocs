## About The Data Lake

A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can store your data as-is, without having to first structure the data. We have implemented a “virtual” data lake that allows for iterative acquisition, enhancement and publishing of various data assets in the form of datasets.

## Gaining Access


Getting setup with the ability to drop files into the data lake is easy. It will require you to request access to a global group using an automated process integrated in Compass. 

Hold ***CTRL*** and click ***[HERE](https://kochprod.service-now.com/compass/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=113defe6db93b3047eee785e0f961978)*** for a direct link to the Compass form to open in a new seperate window.

Group Name: **KOCH\GG_KCS_ALL_EMPLOYEES**

After submitting your request, it may take up to ***3 business days*** for your request to be complete. You can test access by accessing either the Development or Production link below. 
*Note:* Once added to the global group, you will have access to both environments. 

**[Development Data Lake](https://datalake-dev.kcs.kochcloud.com)** - https://datalake-dev.kcs.kochcloud.com/ 

**[Production Data Lake](https://datalake-prod.kcs.kochcloud.com)** - https://datalake-prod.kcs.kochcloud.com/

## First Looks

The first time you log into the data lake you may be asked to authenticate and will see a screen like this:

No need to worry, KochID will redirect you back to the data lake once it verifies you are are member of the global group. Get started by clicking the ***REAUTHENTICATE*** button to sign in with KochID. 

## First Logon Success

If everything worked as it should you will see you a page similar to below. Notice "Content Explorer" has replaced "Acces Denied" and your name is in the right corner of the screen.
