<h1>Getting Started</h1>

In order to view your data outside for the Data Lake UI, you will first need to install and configure the driver for the program you plan on using. A few of the common drivers are outlined below along with information on how to configure/request them. 


## Snowflake

The first step in the process is to request the driver to be installed on your computer. A Compass form has been created to automate this process and can be accessed [HERE]('https://kochprod.service-now.com/compass?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=5e31dacadb061010428baa82ca9619b9')

### Filling out the Form

**You will see a screen similar to the image below. You will need to check the 2 boxes under the Purchase Approval section to be allowed to select your computer name**

**Once those boxes have been checked, you will see the option to select your PC name. If you leave the default selection of "Assigned to me", only your PC information will be shown.**

**After selecting your PC from the list, leave all the default billing and shipping information since the driver will be pushed to your PC remotely. Click on the "Order Now" button to submit your request.**
